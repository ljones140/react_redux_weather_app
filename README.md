# React-Redux City Weather App

This application was created following @stephenGrider 's Udemy course [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).

This purpose of this application was to understand the way that Redux manages
state with React applications.


### To Run

```
> git clone https://github.com/ljones140/react_redux_weather_app.git
> cd react_redux_weather_app
```

You will need to obtain an Open Weather API key from:
https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

The API key then needs to be added to the application in:

```
src/actions/index.js
const API_KEY = 'put api key here';
```

Then download the NPM dependencies and start the application

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

The app will be runnon on localhost:8080
